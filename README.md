Project Description
During my three-week internship at 7Span, I gained foundational knowledge in web development, which I applied in creating NexusInfo. This project highlights my ability to build interactive and responsive web applications using key web technologies.

Features
Responsive Design: Implemented using HTML, CSS, and Sass to ensure a seamless experience across devices.
Dynamic UI: Utilized JavaScript and React.js for creating interactive and engaging user interfaces.
Component-Based Architecture: Employed React.js to build modular and scalable components, optimizing rendering performance with the virtual DOM.
Learning Experience
My internship provided me with valuable insights into various aspects of web and app development:

Web Development: Gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, enhancing the functionality and user experience of web applications.
App Development: Developed basic skills in user interface design and functionality, with a focus on cross-platform mobile app development using Flutter.
IT Solutions and System Architecture: Acquired an understanding of system architecture and troubleshooting.
Programming Skills: Enhanced my programming capabilities with Python through simple scripts and automation tasks.
Collaboration and Communication
Working in a collaborative environment at 7Span, I improved my practical knowledge of front-end development and fostered effective communication and teamwork skills. This project, NexusInfo, is a testament to the technical expertise and hands-on proficiency I developed during my internship.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
